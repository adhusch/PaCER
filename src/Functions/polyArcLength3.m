function arcLength = polyArcLength3(polyCoeff, lowerLimit, upperLimit)
%
% USAGE:
%
%    arcLength = polyArcLength3(polyCoeff, lowerLimit, upperLimit)
%
% INPUTS: 
%    polyCoeff:     Coefficient matrix
%    lowerLimit:    Lower limit, taken as scalar or vector input. If put in as a vector,
%                   arc lengths are returned for all pairs of intervals between the lower   
%                   and upper limit.
%    upperLimit:    Upper limit, taken as scalar or vector input. If put in as a vector,
%                   arc lengths are returned for all pairs of intervals between the upper   
%                   and lower limit.
%
% OUTPUT: 
%    arcLength:     The arc length is defined as the integral of the norm of the 
%                   derivatives of the parameterized equations.
