function [elecStruct, rms, d] = determineElectrodeType(peakDistances)
% gets the most suitable electrode type based on the euclidean distance between 
% detected and specified peaks in the collected data. Data should should be provided 
% in the form of the file 'electrodeGeometries.mat'. 
%
% USAGE:
%
%    [electStruct, rms, d] = determineElectrodeType(peakDistances)
%
% INPUT: 
%    peakDistances:     The peak distances between the signals, provided by the inserted 
%                       data sheet.   
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%    electStruct:       Electrode Type.
%    rms:               Root-mean-square of the distance between the electrode signals.
%    d:                 Euclidian distance to the closest electrode prototype
