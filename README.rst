Background
----------

.. begin-intro-marker

The PaCER Toolbox is a MATLAB
implementation of a robust method to fully automatically reconstruct
deep brain stimulation trajectories from post operative CT imaging
data. PaCER is able to fully preserving electrode bending (e.g. caused
by brainshift). Further is able to detect individual contacts on
high-resolution data. The PaCER toolbox is provided with means to
easily visualize electrodes as well as imaging data within the MATLAB
environment.

Getting Started
----------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. begin-req-marker

The requirements to use PaCER are:

- **MATLAB**, including the Image Processing Toolbox
- **post-operative CT image** in **nifti** file format.

A **CT slice-thickness <= 1 mm** is recommended, however, PaCER will work
on lower resolution data too by falling back to a less sophisticated
contact detection method (yielding lower accuracy). Nifti input files
are supported in compressed form (.nii.gz) as well as non-compressed
(.nii).

.. end-req-marker

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. begin-gs-marker

The easiest way to learn about PaCER is to run the example files. We
recommend to add the PaCER directory and all its subdirectories to your
MATLAB path first. This can be archived by running the file
SETUP_PACER.m in MATLAB (once). The examples include a call to
SETUP_PACER.

The following examples require only a post op CT dataset - they should
work out of the box for most CT scan protocols as long as the slice
thickness is not toooo bad :-) Easy conversion from DICOM to NIFTI is
possible dcm2nii which is included in
`MRIcron <https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron/>`__. Advanced example
demonstrating further use-cases (e.g. visualisation of segmentations and
atlas data, simple volume of tissue activated model etc.) can be found
in the examples/advanced/ directory. However these examples require
appropriate co-registered image modalities (e.g. atlases, segmentation).
We are in the process to provide a full example dataset in the future.

-  **EXAMPLE_1.m** - Basic PaCER call and electrode plot. Start here!

   -  **EXAMPLE_1_1.m** - Continues EXAMPLE_1 by adding an **MPR view**
      of the CT image and demonstrating some **plot customisations**
